          <h3>B.Sc</h3>
          <h4>Bachelor of Science</h4>
          <p>
            Bachelor of Science(B.Sc) is usually a three year graduate program
            in India offered by state and central universities. Some independent
            private colleges can also offer BS degrees albeit minimum changes in
            curriculum. B.Sc is different from Bachelor of Engineering(B.E) or
            Bachelor of Technology(B.Tech)

          <h3>MBA</h3>
          <h4>Master of Business Administration</h4>
          <p>
            There are now more than 50 business schools in Bangladesh offering
            the MBA, predominantly targeting graduates without any work
            experience. Most MBAs are two years full-time. Sensibly there is
            little use of GMAT. The Business Schools conduct their own admission
            tests instead although the rationale for this instead of providing
            introductory courses and certifications is unclear. Classes are
            taught in English

        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>BBA</h3>
          <h4>Bachelor of Business Administration</h4>
          <p>
            The degree is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional
            aspects of a company and their interconnection, while also allowing
            specialization in a particular area. BBA programs thus expose
            students to a variety of "core subjects" and generally allow
            students to specialize in a specific academic area; see aside.
